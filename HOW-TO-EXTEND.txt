Right now there are 4 possible modularization points:

	1) LogFactoryProvider
	2) DestinationFactoryProvider
	3) ParcelFactoryProvider
	4) DeliveryQueueProvider

All of them use dependency injector to inject LogFactory, DestinationFactory,
ParcelFactory and DeliveryQueue respectively.
To override any of these it is necessary to create @Injectable-annotated class
which implements corresponding interface and has ranking > 1.
For example:

	@Injectable(type = LogFactory.class, ranking = 2)
	public final class CustomLogFactory implements LogFactory {

		@Override
		public Log getLog(String name) {
			return new CustomLogImpl(name);
		}

	}

To override processing logic it is necessary to provide new implementation for
the DeliveryQueue interface.
