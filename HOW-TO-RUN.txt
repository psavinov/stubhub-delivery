Prerequisites:
	- JDK 8 is installed and properly configured (I used Oracle's JDK 1.8.0_92)
	- Maven 3.0+ is installed and properly configured (I used Maven 3.3.9)

Install, test, run
	In the repository root execute the following commands:

	    chmod +x do  (run this only on UNIX-like systems)

	    ./do install
	    ./do test    

	Assert that all the tests pass and execute the following command:

	    ./do run
	    
	! On Windows run "do.cmd" script insteadof "./do" command

	The following command line options are available for the simulation:

		Number of simulation threads(parcels sources):
			-Ddelivery.simulation.thread.count=1

		Time of simulation threads work, in seconds):
			-Ddelivery.simulation.time.seconds=15

		Number of randomly initialized destinations:
			-Ddelivery.simulation.destination.count=5

	When the following line appears, program is ready to use:

	    [INFO] --- exec-maven-plugin:1.6.0:exec (default-cli) @ delivery ---

	Here you can use standard input to enter some predefined data or just
	press enter to launch the simulation with some random data, by default
	simulation takes 15 seconds.
